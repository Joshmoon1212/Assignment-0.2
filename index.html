    Write a program that create a string that represents an 8x8 grid, <br>
    using newline characters to seperate lines.  At each position of the <br>
    there is either a space or a '#' character. The character should form a chessboard<br>
        passing the string to console.log should should show something like this.

when you have a proram that generates this pattern, define a binding size <br>
